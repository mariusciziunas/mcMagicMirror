# MaMi - Magic Mirror

The mirror which will show your:
* time
* weather forecast
* iCloud calendar
* notes (I personally use it for my English vocabulary)
* live trains departures
* live buses departures
* news – sport, technology, sport. It’s your choice what you want to see.

And the most important - this is your new alarm clock. You can set the time from the phone or other device and the mirror will start a Youtube playlist and enables LED lights.

All the detail information can be found on my blog.
